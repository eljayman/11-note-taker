## Installation

This application is entirely web-based. No installation is required.

## Usage

Click the 'Get Started' button to go to the notes page. You will see a sidebar with the stored notes, if there are any, a plus button, which can be used while viewing a note to create a new note, and trash bin buttons on all existing notes which delete the note they are assigned to. While entering a new note a disk button will appear that allows you to save the current note.
